# Plant Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project is aimed at building a deep learning model for plant disease classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of various plant diseases and healthy plants. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify plant images into different disease categories, helping farmers identify and treat diseased plants promptly.


## Overview

This project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** Loading and preprocessing the PlantVillage dataset using TensorFlow's data preprocessing utilities.
   
2. **Model Development:** Building a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification. The model architecture includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers.

3. **Model Training:** Training the CNN model on the training data and evaluating its performance using validation data. The training process includes configuring the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the trained model on a separate test dataset to assess its performance in real-world scenarios.

5. **Prediction:** Implementing a function to make predictions using the trained model and visualize the results.

6. **Model Saving:** Saving the trained model for future use or deployment.



## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avinashmanivannan03/Leaf-disease-classification.git


## Dataset

## Navigate to the project directory

cd plant-disease-classification


## Install the required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Result

The trained model achieves an accuracy of about 90% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying plant diseases (Only Potato).
