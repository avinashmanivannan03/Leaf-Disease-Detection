The code is a Python script written using TensorFlow and Keras for building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images of plant diseases.
It begins by importing necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib.
The dataset used is from the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of various plant diseases and healthy plants.
Data preprocessing steps include resizing, rescaling, and data augmentation.
The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and dense layers.
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss.
It trains the model on the training dataset and evaluates it on the validation and test datasets.
The script includes code for plotting training and validation accuracy and loss.
There's also a function to make predictions on new images using the trained model.
Finally, the model is saved to disk.
